              <h2>Creation</h2>
              <p>
                Pokémon is short for "Pocket Monsters", and was started by Satoshi Tajiri and Ken Sugimori. Tajiri was the writer, and SUgimori was the illustrator.
                Back in 1982, Satoshi started a gaming magazine together with his friends called Game Freak, and decided to start  making his own video games instead of writing about them.
                In 1989, Satoshi turned Game Freak into a gaming company. He and his friends released games such as Pulseman, Yoshi and Mario & Wario.

              <p>
                Inspired by his childhood forests and finding forests and catching bugs and finising tadpoles, Satoshi came up with the idea for Pocket Monsters, more widely known as Pokémon, and pitched it to Nintendo.
                Nintendo was a bit unsure about Pocket Monsters, but eventually accpeted.
